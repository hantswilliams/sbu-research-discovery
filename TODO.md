- Need to add enhancement to look for authors/colaborators across the school that we have collaborated on research together; like some type of count that tells us how many internal authors we have collaborated with with SHP, or within the school of medicine, etc.

<!-- - need to update db from sqlite to mysql / fallsprevention db so we can make sure that the cronb job secript that can be run properly 
    - currently in the github/actions folder the cronjob is setup to connect to the sqlite db but we need to change it to the mysql db
    - need to update the db connection string in the cronjob script to connect to the mysql db
    - in addition need to refactor the code to use the mysql db instead of the sqlite db in the main codebase -->
